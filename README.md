# GxEPD
A simple E-Paper display library with common base class and separate IO class for Arduino.

- For SPI e-paper displays from Dalian Good Display 
- and SPI e-paper boards from Waveshare

- [GxEPD2](https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2) is better suited for new users or new projects!

### important note :
- these displays are for 3.3V supply and 3.3V data lines
- never connect data lines directly to 5V Arduino data pins, use e.g. 4k7/10k resistor divider
- series resistor only is not enough for reliable operation (back-feed effect through protection diodes)
- 4k7/10k resistor divider may not work with flat cable extensions or Waveshare 4.2 board, use level converter then
- do not forget to connect GND
- the actual Waveshare display boards now have level converters and series regulator, safe for 5V

### Paged Drawing, Picture Loop for AVR
- This library uses paged drawing to cope with RAM restriction and missing single pixel update support
- Paged drawing is implemented using callbacks to callback functions in the user application code,
- the picture loop is internal to the display classes and calls the callback function as many times as needed,
- this is a different implementation compared to the picture loop in U8G2 (Oliver Kraus)
- see also https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki/tpictureloop

### The E-Paper display base class is a subclass of Adafruit_GFX, to have graphics and text rendering.

- It needs up to 15kB available RAM to buffer the black/white image for the SPI displays, 
- double for 3-color, for e-papers up to 4.2" (300 * 400 / 8, 2 * 300 * 400 / 8).
- ESP8266, ESP32 , STM32 systems, Arduino Due e.g. have enough free RAM for full graphics buffer.
- It needs more RAM for e-paper displays above the 4.2".
- Paged Drawing is available to cope with RAM restriction on AVR processors or for big displays.

#### Supported SPI e-paper panels & boards from Waveshare: compare with Good Display, same panel

### I can and will only support e-paper panels I have!
- promotion panels from suppliers are welcome, to add support to GxEPD
- donation panels from users are welcome, to add support to GxEPD

### for pin mapping suggestions see ConnectingHardware.md

### Version 3.1.1
- added support for GDEM029T94 2.9" b/w, actual Waveshare 2.9" b/w
- updated example GxEPD_WiFi_Example, for actual GitHub certificate
#### Version 3.1.0
- added support for GDEH0154D67 1.54" b/w, replacement for GDEP015OC1
- added example GxEPD_MinimumExample, e.g. for memory footprint
#### Version 3.0.9
- fixed BMP handling, e.g. for BMPs created by ImageMagick
- see also Arduino Forum Topic https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=642343.0
- added support for GDEW075T7 7.5" b/w 800x480
- GDEW075T7 has differential update (1.6s) using a charge balancing waveform
- added "fast partial update" (differential update) for GDEW0371W7 3.7" b/w 240x416

- note that all differential refresh waveforms are a compromise (ghosting, big font use)
- parameters for differential waveform for these display can easily be changed for experimenting
- GDEW042T2 would have greyed background without sustain phase
- GDEW042T2 needs multiple full refreshes after extended use of partial updates
